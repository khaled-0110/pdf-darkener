# 🌙 PDF Dark Mode Converter

A Streamlit web application that converts PDFs with white backgrounds and dark text into **dark mode PDFs** for improved eye comfort.
The app works with both **text-based and scanned PDFs** by converting pages to images and applying smart image processing techniques.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🌙 Convert PDFs to dark mode (black background, light text)
* 📄 Supports **text-based and scanned PDFs**
* 🧠 Automatic background detection
* 📦 **Batch PDF upload**
* 🎛 Adjustable contrast and brightness
* ⬇️ Download converted PDFs instantly
* ☁️ Deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit** – web interface
* **pdf2image** – PDF to image conversion
* **Pillow (PIL)** – image processing
* **NumPy & OpenCV** – background detection
* **Poppler** – system dependency for PDF rendering

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User uploads one or more PDFs
2. Each page is converted to an image
3. The app detects whether the page background is mostly white
4. A smart dark-mode filter is applied
5. Processed pages are rebuilt into a new PDF
6. User downloads the dark-mode PDF
